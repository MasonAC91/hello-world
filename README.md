# hello-world
I'm Mason and I'm learning how to be a .net developer on my own. 
With absolutely zero background in coding or advance computer work I'm working to learn the ins and out of C# and contiuning to learning important concepts/programs for .NET
I also love pizza and axe throwing in my backyard.
